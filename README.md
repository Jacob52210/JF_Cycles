#My name is Jacob Flora.
#My website is hosted at https://jacob52210.github.io/JF_Cycles/
My web site is for a fake motorcycle repair shop called JF Cycles.
You can navigate my website by using my easily identifiable nav bar on the top right. 
You can order parts, browse work that weve done, contact us via form.
I used .html, .css, .js to code my website.
in the future I would like to make it more mobile friendly, add more features by utilizing javascript, 
and I would like to make it more personal for the user.
